My name is Alex Salom and I currently serve as an iOS Engineer at **WeltN24 GmbH** in Berlin, Germany.

This website has gone through many incarnations and the one you are seeing is the latest. Previously I went for complex CMSes in horrible and expensive hosting companies. That has changed.
What you are seeing now is the awesome <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with a modified theme called <a href="https://github.com/biomadeira/sustain">Sustain</a>.

> Jekyll allows you to build blog aware static websites letting you focus on the content instead of the management.

What should you expect from this site? Swift, iOS, tech stuff -books included-, code, maybe some music too... just the mumbles you would hear if you were working next to me.

```swift
class Person {
  func who() -> String {
    return "Alex Salom"
  }
  func wo() -> String {
    return "Berlin, Germany."
  }
  func what() -> [String] {
    return ["code", "music", "ci", "ios"]
  }
}
```

## Welcome
